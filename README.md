# IntroductionToRobotics
This repo reflects my learning journey in the field of robotics, so I'll be uploading here the projects I make for university (2023-2024) in order to understand the basic concepts.

# Homework 1
For this project, I connected an RGB led to 3 potentiometers, which allow me to control the 3 colors of the led: Red, Green and Blue. 
I connected the cathods of the LED to the ports ~3, ~5 and ~6, making sure to add a resistor for each (values ranging from 100 to 220 Ohms), while the potentiometers are connected to the A0, A1 and A2 ports. In the end I made sure they're also connected to GND, as well as to the power source (ports VIN and GND).
When I connect the project to the source code, each potentiometer controls its own color, having the possibility to play with light intensities simultaneously, also creating white light when all 3 colors are at their maximum intesity.
